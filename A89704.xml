         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving long and ſadly expected the ſettlement of this Kingdome in a firme and laſting Peace, freed from all Tyranny and oppreſſion, and that the Free-borne People of this Land may enjoy ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and Priviledges as of right belong unto us, which we being in ſome preſent and apparent hope (by the goodneſſe of God) to enjoy; and having alwaies profeſſed and owned that Principle of <hi>doing to others as we would be done unto,</hi> have thought fit to propound to thoſe, who are at preſent impowered and intruſted by us the People, as our <hi>Repreſentatives,</hi> ſome additionall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to be inſerted into the <hi>Peoples Agreement,</hi> and theſe as well in behalfe and out of a fellow-feeling of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers intereſts, as of our owne, being clearly in order to that ſo often repeated and promiſed <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> which promiſe we are confident hath cauſed ſome inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts to acquieſce, which otherwiſe might in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have aſſiſted or adhered unto our profeſſed enemies, even in the time of ours and the Armies greateſt Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; But now ſince God has been pleas'd to ſubjugate our enemies, and thus far to advance and owne this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162529:3"/> cauſe, we hope this ſucceſſe of the ſword will not cauſe any of the chiefe Officers of the Army or others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from their former principles, or forget their ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten declared <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> without exception; In confidence whereof, and in order whereunto, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all penall Statutes againſt non-conformiſts in Religion may be forthwith repealed, and made null, ſince for the moſt part all the well-affected and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men of this Kingdome are as well concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and lyable thereunto, as the Papiſts. And that all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Peace, Purſuivants, or other Perſecutors, that ſhall any waies proceed upon any of thoſe Statutes, may be ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Oathes of Supremacy and Allegiance, with the Nationall Covenant, and all other compulſory Oathes may be effectually declared againſt, and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there may be a free and unmoleſted exerciſe of Religion, at leaſt in private houſes, for all ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that profeſſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> none excepted.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That no perſon be forced to pay or contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintenance of the publique Miniſters, who out of Conſcience cannot ſubmit thereunto, but that they may be provided for in ſome other unoppreſſive way.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That (as it hath been well propounded by others againſt Lawyers, and the expence and protraction of Law Suites, ) ſo likewiſe, that the exceſſive Fees of Phyſitians may be regulated and reduced, whereby the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:162529:3"/> poore for a ſmall and reaſonable Fee may have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their skill; As in <hi>France,</hi> a Phyſitians common Fee for coming to a patient is a <hi>Quard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſcu,</hi> or 1. ſh. 6. d.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the Lands and Goods of all Papiſts, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be lawfully charged or convicted by two ſufficient witneſſes either to have been in Arms againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or to have aided or aſſiſted the King, be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſcharged of all ſequeſtrations, and unjuſt ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zures; ſince that delinquency being cleared, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they ſuffer meerly for Conſcience ſake, if ſtill ſequeſtred.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That Papiſts in Armes may be no worſe dealt with in their Compoſitions then others in Armes; ſince to lay a Fine or mulct upon their Religion, is no waies in order to <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. That no perſon be diſabled from bearing any Office in the Common-Wealth, for any opinion or practiſe in Religion, though contrary to the publique way.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That all perſons whatſoever now in durance, who cannot be charged with any crime againſt the State, or are not impriſoned for debt, but that ſuffer only for <hi>Conſcience ſake,</hi> may be forthwith diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps may here object, that to grant thus much, would be too much in favour of the Papiſts; Whereunto we anſwer, That as we beare them no more love then what one Chriſtian is bound to ſhew unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and their tenets much leſſe; ſo we are clear of opinion, that it cannot perfectly be ſaid to be <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> nor can it be warranted by Scripture, that they or any others that weare the Title of Chriſtians, ſhould be excluded; beſides, if any reſtrictions or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:162529:4"/> ſhall be continued on the Papiſts, though for the preſent we and other well-affected perſons may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and unmoleſted, yet we know not how ſoon the ſame Lawes or penalties by any change of times, may be laid upon us; As hath been too evident of late yeares, when as the penall Statutes which we know were prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily intended againſt Papiſts and their Adherents, were made a foundation for the Biſhops to exerciſe their Lordly and tyrannicall wills over many peaceable and conſcientious men, for non-conformity in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>Here we may add the conſiſtency of <hi>Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> with many, nay moſt Governments, whether Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall, Popular, or mixt, As in <hi>France, Holland, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Switzerland,</hi> &amp;c. where diverſity of Faith exiles no confidence, but perſons of all Religions are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently employed and found faithfull in Offices and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of greateſt truſt.</p>
            <p>Againe if there be ſuch penalties and reſtrictions put upon mens Conſciences, they cannot be termed Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne People, and Engliſh Natives, but rather aliens, outlawes or men bar'd of all propriety of perſons and goods, and without the protection of the Lawes, which are every mans birth-right; and what is the caſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to day, may be ours tomorrow, according to the ebb or flow of fortune.</p>
            <p>Here perhaps ſome others will object and ſay, that though all other Religions ought to be tolerated, yet Papiſts ought not, becauſe they are Idolaters; whereto if you will take the anſwer, which we have heard ſome of them deliver (for we think it juſt to hear all parties,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:162529:4"/> and hold it a work of Charity to convert any, by arguments from the <hi>Written Word)</hi> their anſwer is this, that they give not Pictures or ſuch repreſentations (as they call them) any Soveraigne honor, which is that that properly belongs to God, but an inferiour or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive kind of reverence or honor.</p>
            <p>And if we take Papiſts in our or the common received ſence, yet we cannot ſay they are ſuch Idolaters, as thoſe mentioned in the old Teſtament, who abſolutely adored, even with Soveraigne honor, the Images of falſe Gods, which theſe Papiſts (for ought we can learne) doe not doe, but doe adore the Image of the true God; and therefore cannot properly be called Idolaters, at leaſt in Scripture ſence, but rather ſuperſtitious and Popiſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing it to be lawfull or warranted by the Word of God, to perſecute the Papiſts or any other ſort of people profeſſing <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet we have obſerved in theſe laſt 7. years of their perſecution, (which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe has been very ſevere, and we beleeve that their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, if they ever get the power, will be as rigid and unchriſtian towards us) when many of them have been hang'd, drawn and quartered, others 7. or 8. yeares im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned onely for refuſing ſuch oathes as we, or perhaps the perſecutors themſelves cannot in conſcience take, and many of their Eſtates ſequeſtred onely for non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in matters of Religion, yet we doe not ſee that this perſecution hath any thing at all abated or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened the number of them, but that they are rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd by ſuffering; ſo that whether we reſpect our own principle, of <hi>doing to others as we would be done unto,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:162529:5"/> or be ſteered by reaſons of Religion or of common po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, we humbly offer and think fit, that no <hi>Agreement</hi> of the People be concluded (or offered to publike teſt) by any <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> but that as a principal &amp; materiall part which belongs to God, Liberty of Conſcience to all that profeſſe Chriſt without exception may be inſerted, and the foreſaid grievances redreſſed; ſo ſhall we with all true and Free-borne Engliſh men joyne hands and hearts againſt all Enemies to Peace and Godlineſſe.</p>
